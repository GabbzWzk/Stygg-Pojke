* Healing Toggle:
	Currently there is 3 different options, no heal, heal self and heal all. However is there a option really to not heal?
	Eternal flame playstyle is at this stage most common way and we should always have the HoT on us. We should not use HP for the initial heal, that is more
	for the Word Of Glory healing. Enhancing current Eternal Flame would be to be able to cast the HoT on secondary target mainly or select prioritised targets.
	Doing a blanket style of healing is kind of overkill.

	The Word of Glory healing is more checking most injured and heal them if they are belov a threshold.
	Why are checking for more then 3 and not 5 stacks of Bastion?
